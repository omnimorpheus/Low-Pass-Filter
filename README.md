# Low-Pass-Filter
The main objective is to learn to use the FPGA to display a grayscale image in raw format on the VGA with the help of storing in .coe file. Further, we learn how to implement a LBF on the given image, pressing the “0” key should pass the image through our LPF but should also retain the output so that when pressed the ‘o’ key again, it gets fed as the input to the LPF again. The character should be displayed in the top left corner of the VGA monitor.
